      "\n",
      "### Explanation\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Data Structure**:\n",
      "   - `low`: A max-heap (simulated with a min-heap using negation) that contains the smaller half of the numbers.\n",
      "   - `high`: A min-heap that contains the larger half of the numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Adding a Number (`addNum`)**:\n",
      "   - The new number is added to the max-heap (`low`) as a negative value to maintain the max-heap property.\n",
      "   - We check if the max of the lower half is greater than the min of the upper half; if so, we need to move the maximum from `low` to `high` to maintain the heap properties.\n",
      "   - We also rebalance if `low` has more than one extra element compared to `high` or if `high` has more elements than `low`.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Finding the Median (`findMedian`)**:\n",
      "   - If `low` has more elements than `high`, the median is the top of the `low` heap (the largest of the lower half).\n",
      "   - If both heaps are of equal size, the median is the average of the tops of both heaps.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Edge Cases to Consider\n",
      "- Adding numbers in a sequence that creates large differences between heaps.\n",
      "- When initial numbers lead to an uneven distribution.\n",
      "- Handling duplicate numbers.\n",
      "- Starting with an empty data structure and adding numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Balancing Heaps\n",
      "- After every addition, we check:\n",
      "  - If the number of elements in `low` exceeds `high` by more than 1, we move the maximum from `low` to `high`.\n",
      "  - If `high` contains more elements than `low`, we move the minimum from `high` back to `low`.\n",
      "  \n",
      "This ensures the heaps remain balanced, allowing the median to be computed in constant time. \n",
      "\n",
      "This implementation provides an efficient solution to dynamically track the median with the desired time complexities for both operations.\n"
